				User Story
			</header>
			<p>
				In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers or development team members.
			</p>
			<p>
				User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication, that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.[1]
			</p>
			<p>
				User stories are often confused with system requirements. A requirement is a formal description of need; a user story is an informal description of a feature.

				History
			</header>
			<p>
				In 1998 Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."[2]
			</p>
			<p>
				With Extreme Programming (XP),[3] user stories were a part of the planning game.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2001, Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:[4]
				<li>
					The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible durable physical token to hold the concepts;


				</li>
				<li>
					The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
				</li>
				<li>
					The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.	
				</li>

				Common templates
			</header>
			<p>
				User stories may follow one of several formats or templates. The most common would be the Connextra template:[5][6]

As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>
Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering software, and proposed this alternative:[7]

In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>
Elias Weldemichael, on the other hand, suggested the "so that" clause is perhaps optional although still often helpful:[8]

As a <role>, I can <goal/desire>, so that <why>
Another template based on the Five Ws specifies:[citation needed]

As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>
Another template based on Rachel Davies' popular template:[9]

As <persona>, I can <what?> so that <why?>
where a persona is a fictional stakeholder (e.g. user). A persona may include a name, picture; characteristics, behaviors, attitudes, and a goal which the product should help them achieve.
