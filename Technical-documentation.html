				User Story
			</header>
			<p>
				In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers or development team members.
			</p>
			<p>
				User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication, that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.[1]
			</p>
			<p>
				User stories are often confused with system requirements. A requirement is a formal description of need; a user story is an informal description of a feature.

				History
			</header>
			<p>
				In 1998 Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."[2]
			</p>
			<p>
				With Extreme Programming (XP),[3] user stories were a part of the planning game.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2001, Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:[4]
				<li>
					The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible durable physical token to hold the concepts;


				</li>
				<li>
					The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
				</li>
				<li>
					The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.	
				</li>

		<section class="main-section" id="Common_templates" >

				Common templates
			</header>
			<p>
				User stories may follow one of several formats or templates. The most common would be the Connextra template:[5][6]
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>
					</li>
				Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully 					delivering software, and proposed this alternative:[7]
				
			</p>
			<li>
				In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>
				</li>	
				<p>
			Elias Weldemichael, on the other hand, suggested the "so that" clause is perhaps optional although still often helpful:[8]
						</p>

			<p>
				<li>
				As a <role>, I can <goal/desire>, so that <why>
					</li>
			Another template based on the Five Ws specifies:[citation needed]
			
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>
				As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>
					</li>
			Another template based on Rachel Davies' popular template:[9]
			</p>

			<p>
				<li>
				As <persona>, I can <what?> so that <why?>
				</li>
			where a persona is a fictional stakeholder (e.g. user). A persona may include a name, picture; characteristics, behaviors, attitudes, and a goal which the product should help them achieve.

			<code>Screening Quiz (Epic Story)</code>

			<p>
				As the HR manager, I want to create a screening quiz so that I can understand whether I want to send possible recruits to the functional manager.[10]
			</p>
			<code>Quiz Recall</code>
			<p>
				As a manager, I want to browse my existing quizzes so I can recall what I have in place and figure out if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.[10]
			</p>

			<code>Limited Backup</code>
			<p>
				As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.[11]
			</p>

				Usage
			</header>
			<p>
				As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user stories define what has to be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.
			</p>
			<p>
				When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every user story must at some point have one or more acceptance tests attached, allowing the developer to test when the user story is done and also allowing the customer to validate it. Without a precise formulation of the requirements, prolonged nonconstructive arguments may arise when the product is to be delivered.

				Benefits
			</header>
			<p>
				There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which is linked to success.[12]

		<section class="main-section" id="Limitations">
			<header >
				Limitations
			</header>
			<p>
				Limitations of user stories include:
			</p>
			<code>
				Scale-up problem
			</code>
			<p>
				User stories written on small physical cards are hard to maintain, difficult to scale to large projects and troublesome for geographically distributed teams.
			</p>
			<code>
				Vague, informal and incomplete
			</code>
			<p>
				User story cards are regarded as conversation starters. Being informal, they are open to many interpretations. Being brief, they do not state all of the details necessary to implement a feature. Stories are therefore inappropriate for reaching formal agreements or writing legal contracts.[13]
			</p>
			<code>
				Lack of non-functional requirements
			</code>
			<p>
				User stories rarely include performance or non-functional requirement details, so non-functional tests (e.g. response time) may be overlooked.
